# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for the ZenithDB project.

## Build Scripts

### `build-optimized.sh` (Linux/macOS) and `build-optimized.cmd` (Windows)

These scripts provide optimized builds for the ZenithDB application, helping avoid unnecessary recompilation of components.

#### Features

- Checks for file changes before rebuilding frontend or Rust code
- Supports multiple targets: desktop, android, ios
- Supports build types: release (default) and debug
- Maintains build artifacts caching to speed up repeated builds
- CI/CD friendly with environment variable support

#### Usage (Linux/macOS)

```bash
# Make the script executable first
chmod +x scripts/build-optimized.sh

# Build desktop release (default)
./scripts/build-optimized.sh build desktop release

# Build desktop debug
./scripts/build-optimized.sh build desktop debug

# Build Android
./scripts/build-optimized.sh build android release

# Clean all build artifacts
./scripts/build-optimized.sh clean

# Set environment variable to force rebuild
FORCE_BUILD=true ./scripts/build-optimized.sh build
```

#### Usage (Windows)

```cmd
REM Build desktop release (default)
scripts\build-optimized.cmd build release

REM Build desktop debug
scripts\build-optimized.cmd build desktop debug

REM Build Android
scripts\build-optimized.cmd build android release

REM Clean all build artifacts
scripts\build-optimized.cmd clean
```

#### Advanced Usage

You can use the `FORCE_BUILD` environment variable to skip change detection and force a full rebuild:

```bash
FORCE_BUILD=true ./scripts/build-optimized.sh build
```

## Version Synchronization Script

### `sync-versions.sh`

This script ensures version consistency across all project files:

- `package.json` (frontend version)
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (backend version)
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (Tauri configuration)
- `src/environments/environment.ts` (Angular environment configuration)
- `flatpak/com.tcs.zenithdb.yml` (Flatpak manifest)
- `flatpak/com.tcs.zenithdb.metainfo.xml` (App metadata)

#### Usage

```bash
# Update all files to a new version
./scripts/sync-versions.sh 1.2.3
```

This script will update the version in all the relevant files and add a new release entry to the metainfo.xml file with the current date.

#### Files Updated

When you run the script:

1. Updates the version field in `package.json`
2. Updates the version field in `Cargo.toml`
3. Updates the version field in `tauri.conf.json`
4. Updates the version field in `environment.ts`
5. Updates the version field in the Flatpak manifest
6. Adds a new release entry to the metainfo.xml with current date

This ensures consistency across all version references in the project.
